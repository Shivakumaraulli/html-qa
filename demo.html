    <!--HTML DAY 1
    1. Difference between div and span?
<div> tag stands for division tag and it is inline-block-level element means it is bound to take the whole width of the screen.
<span> tag is an inline element means it only takes the space that is required for it. 

2. Difference between class and IDs?
In HTML, the only difference between class and ID is that IDs are unique and each element can have only one ID. On the otherhand classes are not unique we can use same class on multiple elements.
•	IDs: Each page can have only one element with that ID.
•	CLASS: You can use multiple classes on the same element.

3. What are self-closing tags?
In HTML, A self-closing tag is a type of tag that need not have to have closing tag, only opening tag will be enough.

<br> is an empty element without a closing tag (the <br> tag defines a line break).
Empty elements can be "closed" in the opening tag like this: <br />.

Example: <img /> ,  <input /> ,  <br />.

4. How many types of heading tags are there? How to decide which to use where?
There are six levels of heading tags are there in HTML.



5. Difference between block and inline?
A block element always begins on a new line and extends to left and right, and it takes the full width available on the webpage. Browsers automatically add some space(margin) before and after element.
Examples of block elements are <div>, <p>, <h1>to<h6>, <table> and <form> etc.
An inline element does not begin on a new line. It only takes the space that is necessary for it.
Examples of inline elements are <a>, <span>, <img>, <input>, <label> etc.

6. Difference between <em> and <strong>?
The <strong> and <em> tags are used for emphasizing parts of a text.
The <strong> tag should be used to indicate strong importance, or urgency, like to indicate key phrases in a text for someone skimming it.
The <em> tag should be used to represent stress emphasis, like when you'd read the emphasized text in a different tone of voice. Both tags can be used together, where it makes sense.

7. What are Attributes?
In HTML, Attributes are special words which provide additional information about the elements and are the modifiers of HTML element.
Attributes should be written in lowercase only as they are case sensitive. It should always be applied with its name and value pair.
It should always be applied with the start tag, we can add multiple attributes to an element by giving space between two attributes.

8. Difference between HTML Tags and Elements?
HTML tags- Tags are the starting and ending part of an HTML element. They begin with “<” symbol and end with “>”. Whatever written inside < and > are called tags. For instance: -- <b></b>
HTML elements – Elements enclose the contents in between the tags. They consist of some kind of structure. It generally consists of a start tag, content and end tag. For instance: -- <b>Content</b>

9. Explain <br /> tag?
The <br> tag in HTML document is used to create a line break in a text. It is an empty tag which means it does not need end tag like </br>.
